# Project Overview
Welcome back to Popular Movies! In this second and final stage, you’ll add additional functionality to the app you built in Stage 1.

### You’ll add more information to your movie details view:

* **You’ll allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).**
* **You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.**
* **You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star).**
* **You'll create a database and content provider to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies (and optionally, the rest of the information needed to display their favorites collection while offline).**
* **You’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.**
* **Recall from Stage 1, you built a UI that presented the user with a grid of movie posters, allowed users to change sort order, and presented a screen with additional information on the movie selected by the user.**

### Note to the reviewer:

To add your api key, add it to gradle.properties file like this:
* **my_api="your_api_key_here"**
